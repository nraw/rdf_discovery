# Exploring the web

## What?

Ummm.. A way to browse through the semantic web datasets out there, but mostly about checking out ontologies.

## How?

Check the `Makefile`

the triplets.py will generate 2 files, one to check the unique terms in the namespace, the other will have the triplets in a csv. I use `fzf` to check through those.
